You can either watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z56Jmr9Z34Q&list=PLyzOVJj3bHQuloKGG59rS43e29ro7I57J) or read it [here](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/course-shell/). The second lecture is about scripting and also has a video and a [reading format](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/shell-tools/).
